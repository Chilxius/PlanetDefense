Smartboard Game
I developed this game over a few days. It is designed to be played on a touchscreen, but could be played on a normal computer just fine.
The laser will charge as long as you are pointed toward the button on top. Slower meteors have more health. Meteors that are closer will seem harder to hit; the targeting is based on the angle.
Highscores should automatically store and sort, though I have not tested this extensively.
Share it around!
